 *  Camellia Image Processing Library
 *

    The Camellia Image Processing Library is an open source low-level image processing library.
    As it uses the IplImage structure to describe images, it is a good replacement to the IPL (Intel) library
    and a good complement to the OpenCV library. It includes a lot of functions for image processing
    (filtering, morphological mathematics, labeling, warping, loading/saving images, etc.),
    some of them being highly optimized; It is also cross-platform and robust. It is doxygen-documented
    and examples of use are provided.

    This software library is an outcome of the Camellia european project (IST-2001-34410).
    It was developped by the Ecole des Mines de Paris (ENSMP), in coordination with
    the other partners of the project.
